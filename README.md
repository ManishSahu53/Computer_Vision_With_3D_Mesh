## Summer Research Project for Computer vision

### Description of the Research Project:
* construct a graphic platform for rendering 3D mesh using OpenGL, PyMesh, etc.
* Using Deep Learning to study target mesh location based on tag and large data sets of images

### Installation:
* You need to install [PlyFile](https://github.com/dranjan/python-plyfile)
* [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/download/) library for handling mesh object
* [mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/) library for ploting mesh object

### Optional:
* [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/) for compiling and generating C++ files
* [conda](https://conda.io/docs/intro.html) for installing VTK and mayavi more easily
* [PyMesh](http://pymesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for reading PLY file if you are not familiar with PLYFILE.  
* Here are some easy command lines for installing VTK and mayavi in conda environment:
```
conda install -c anaconda vtk=6.3.0
conda install -c anaconda mayavi=4.5.0
```

More details will be filled in!
