## Summer Research Project for Computer vision

### Description of the Research Project:
* construct a graphic platform for rendering 3D mesh using OpenGL, PyMesh, etc.
* Using Deep Learning to study target mesh location based on tag and large data sets of images

### Installation:
* You need to install [PlyFile](https://github.com/dranjan/python-plyfile)
* [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/download/) library for handling mesh object
* [mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/) library for ploting mesh object

More details will be filled in!
